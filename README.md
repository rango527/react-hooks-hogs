# Must Love Hogs: The React App for Hog Fans

formerly know as Hogwarts

## React Week 1 Project

## topics
  - react components
  - props
  - state
  - at least one functional component and class component (more are fine, too)
  -


1. Let's build a hogIndex to render a link to each hog, which--when clicked-- will diplay the hog's detail. First, we need to list out each hog stored in the HogList const as a card on our main page. When a user clicks the card, it'll expand to render the hog's details. We should be able to toggle the details by clicking on the card.

2. We should be able to filter our HogIndex by a few different parameters (choose the filters that you think will make most sense to your users).

## Bonus Features
 - Some farmers hate to see others' successful hogs! Give users the option to hide a hog that displeases them. Don't delete the hog, HIDE the HOG.
